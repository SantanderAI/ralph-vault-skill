# Contributing to ralph-vault-skill

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a project-agnostic
agent skill plus a dependency-free Python CLI (`scripts/gv.py`). Contributions of
all kinds are welcome: bug reports, documentation, new stack task-maps, prompt
improvements, and code.

By participating, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- **Report a bug** — open a [bug report issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml).
- **Request a feature** — open a [feature request issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml).
- **Submit a change** — follow the fork-based pull request flow below.
- **Report a vulnerability** — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) (do **not** open a public issue).

## Pull Request Process

### For External Contributors

1. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-go-stack-tasks
   ```
3. **Make your changes** following the [Code Style](#code-style) guidelines.
4. **Add tests** for any new functionality.
5. **Update documentation** if your changes affect the public CLI or skill actions.
6. **Commit** with clear messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```
   feat: add go stack task-map
   fix: handle empty frontmatter without crashing
   docs: clarify install path for Codex
   ```
7. **Push** your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`.
8. **Sign the CLA** when prompted by the CLA Assistant bot.
9. **Wait for review** — a maintainer will review your PR within 2 weeks (SLA).

### For Internal Contributors (Santander)

1. **Create a branch** from `main` (no fork needed if you are a member of the org).
2. Follow steps 3-7 above.
3. Request review from the maintainer team in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS).

### PR Requirements

All pull requests must pass the following automated checks before merge:

- [ ] **CI lint and tests** (`ci`) — Linting, formatting, unit tests
- [ ] **Security scan** (`codeql`, `dep-scan`) — SAST and dependency audit
- [ ] **License check** (`license-check`) — Dependency license compatibility
- [ ] **Pattern check** (`pattern-check`) — No internal URLs, IPs, or corporate email addresses
- [ ] **CLA signed** (for external contributors)

Additionally:

- At least **1 maintainer approval** is required.
- All review conversations must be resolved.
- The branch must be up to date with `main`.

## Code Style

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for formatting (line length: 100).
- Use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting.
- Use [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking.
- All public functions and classes must have docstrings (Google style).

### File Headers

Every source file must include the copyright header:

```python

## Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality.
- Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) as the test framework.
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the source structure.
- Run the full test suite before submitting a PR:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/ -v --cov=gv
  ```
- Minimum code coverage target: **80%**.
